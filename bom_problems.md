# Book of Mormon Problems

## Introduction
The Book of Mormon claims to be an ancient text written by and about people who lived somewhere in the Americas between 600 BC and 400 AD.  But how can we know if it is what it claims to be?

The book includes it’s own test (Moroni 10:3-5), which is to read the book, ponder it, and pray about it.  This will result in the Holy Ghost “manifesting” that it’s true.  If you don’t get this result, the book implies that you weren’t sincere enough, that you didn’t have enough faith, or that your intent was not real.

This is not a good test.  First, it never “fails”—it only results in the truth seeker having to repeat the test, presumably for lack of faith, sincerity, or intent.  The test does not admit the possibility that the book might not be “true” (by which I mean:  what it claims to be).

Second, the same test can prove many books true.  Presumably millions of Muslims have read, pondered, and prayed about the Koran.  They have felt a seemingly divine manifestation that it’s true.

Third, if you do get the correct result, it’s just a hard-to-describe feeling that the book is true.  Some say it’s a “burning in the bosom”.  Psychologists call it “elevation”, and they can induce it in a subject during experimentation.  We all experience this same feeling watching certain movies that we know are not factual.  Feelings are not a good way to determine truthfulness.

Let’s instead subject the book to some scrutiny, in an attempt to use logic and reason to determine whether the book is true.  Here’s a short list of problems to consider when deciding if the Book of Mormon as an ancient document containing true scripture given to us by God.

## 1. The Tower of Babel
The story of the Jaredites in the Book of Mormon begins at the Tower of Babel:

Ether 1:33
> Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in his wrath that they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord the people were scattered.

This of course refers to the story from the Bible:

Genesis 11:1-9
> And the **whole earth was of one language, and of one speech**. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad **from thence upon the face of all the earth**: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there **confound the language of all the earth**: and from thence did the LORD **scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth**.

However, we now know that this is not how or when the variety of languages developed. 

Mormons believe the Jaredites made their journey to America about 2200 B.C.  The simple fact is that there are writings in many parts of the ancient world (China, Mesopotamia, Egypt), in widely different languages, dating from a thousand years before the supposed time of the Tower.  This uncontroverted fact shows that the Babel story is only a myth.

Spoken language likely diversified much earlier than that.

There are other Biblical stories upon which the Book of Mormon depends that are also not based on real history, such as the account of Noah’s Ark, the great flood, and the creation.

## 2. Impossible Scripture Quotations
The Book of Mormon quotes scriptures that could not have been on the Brass Plates, and sometimes weren’t even written at the time Book of Mormon prophets are writing.  It is certainly believable that Jesus would say some of the same things to his Old World and New World audiences, but it really stretches credibility to find Moroni more or less quoting Paul, as he does in Moroni 7:45:

> And **charity suffereth long, and is kind**, and **envieth not**, and **is not puffed up**, **seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil**, and **rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things**.

Here is Paul’s version in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7:

> **Charity suffereth long, and is kind**; charity **envieth not**; charity vaunteth not itself, **is not puffed up**, Doth not behave itself unseemly, **seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil**; **Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things**.

There are many examples of this kind of plagiarism in the Book of Mormon.

##3. Second Person Pronouns
The King James Version of the Bible was published in 1611.  One area where the English of 1611 was different from the English of Joseph Smith’s day is pronoun usage.  Second person pronouns could be particularly confusing to a modern speaker.  As a reminder, first person is me talking about myself, second person is me taking to you, and third person is me and you talking about someone else.  Today (and in Joseph Smith’s time), I would use the word “you” no matter if there were one or several of you, or whether you were the subject or object of my sentence.  This chart contrasts this modern usage with the usage of King James’ day:

. | King James English | . | Modern English | .
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
. | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural
Subject | thou | ye | you | you
Object | thee | you | you | you
Possessive | thy, thine | your, yours | your, yours | your, yours

More information can be found at this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou

The Book of Mormon contains errors in the correct grammatical use of these pronouns, as in the following examples:

2 Nephi 1:30-32 (incorrect switching between singular and plural)
> And now, Zoram, I speak unto **you** (should be “thee”): Behold, **thou** (correct) art the servant of Laban...if **ye** (should be “thou”) shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of **thy** (correct) seed with the seed of my son.

2 Nephi 3:1 (incorrect switching between singular and plural)
> And now I speak unto **you** (should be “thee”), Joseph, my last-born. **Thou** (correct) wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow did thy mother bear **thee** (correct).

Mosiah 2:19-20 (object form used as subject)
> O how **you** (should be “ye”) ought to thank **your** (correct) heavenly King! ...if **you** (should be “ye”) should render all the thanks and praise...

There are many examples of “you” incorrectly used as a subject:  Mosiah 2:21, 2:34, 2:40, 4:10, 4:21, 5:15, 12:25, 12:30, 13:10, 18:10, 18:13, 24:14, 29:13; Alma 5:6, 5:16, 5:19, 5:20, 5:22, 5:55, 7:6, 7:17, 7:27, 9:18, 32:28, 32:30, 32:34, 37:16, 38:2; many others.

Alma 36 through 42 contain Alma's advice to his sons, each chapter addressed individually to the named son.  He repeatedly uses "ye" and "you" (plural) rather than the singular "thou" and "thee", although occasionally also using the singular (as in 36:3).

These errors seem to be the result of an attempt to mimic Biblical language without understanding the grammar of 1611 English.  

Numerous statements from contemporaries of Joseph Smith indicate he was given the translated text word for word by the power of God.  It does not seem reasonable to expect these mistakes to be present if the source of the translated text was divine.

## 4. Dross
Dross is a waste by-product of melting metal.  It is the impure, oxidized bits that one skims off the top of the molten metal and discards in order to keep the finished product clean and uniform.  

The Book of Mormon mentions a number of metals, and the use of metal. However, while pre-Columbian tribes used metal, often beaten, there is no accepted evidence of high-temperature melting during book of Mormon times.

The word "dross" appears twice in the Book of Alma.

Alma 32:3
> Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness. Therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as **dross**; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.

Alma 34:29
> [T]herefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as **dross**, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.

These analogies only make sense if the speaker and audience understand the metallurgical processes referenced.  There is no evidence they could have had experience with these concepts.

Sometimes people say that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”.  In other words, maybe smelting occurred in Book of Mormon times and places, and the evidence is out there, but we just haven’t found it yet.  This is possible.  But keep in mind that we have been looking for evidence in places we would expect to find it, and it’s not there.  For example, scientists have actually studied the sediment of lakes in the Andes looking through the layers for pollutants that result from metallurgy.  By looking at those pollutants, they gather evidence about when these processes began, and they can even tell when local people switched from primarily working with copper to primarily working with silver.  Scientists can’t prove definitively that smelting was unknown in South America during Book of Mormon times, but they have a lot of evidence for the conclusions they do make.

“Dross” in the Book of Mormon is an anachronism—something that appears in a creative work that didn’t exist in the time and place which that work is supposed to depict.  For example, if you are reading something that purports to be the journal of George Washington, and it mentions Washington’s favorite iPhone app, you can be absolutely sure that what you are reading is not actually Washington’s journal.  No matter how authentic the journal appears in every other way, or how many facts it contains that are correct, one anachronism (unless it is a later insertion) is enough to show that the journal is not authentic.

The Book of Mormon contains many more anachronisms, including elephants, cattle, swine, barley, wheat, the compass, chariots, breakable windows, steel, metal swords, and more.

## 5. Baptism
We have mentioned several plants, animals, and objects that appear in the Book of Mormon but likely shouldn’t.  Concepts, like the idea of baptism, can also be anachronistic.

Baptism is mentioned as a ritual that is taught and performed among the Nephite civilization; it is first mentioned as being taught by Nephi between 559 and 545 BC.  Ancient Jews at this time period did not practice baptism.

Ancient Jews did perform ritual washings, including by immersion.  Occasions that might require this ritual included touching a corpse, becoming impure due to menstruation, or even washing new cooking utensils.  Ritual washing as part of conversion was not customary until after the Babylonian captivity, which ended decades after baptism was ostensibly taught and practiced in the Book of Mormon.

Other concepts that appear in the Book of Mormon but should include modern concepts of Satan, churches, synagogues, and even the Bible.

## 6. Lucifer
The Book of Mormon preserves some demonstrable mistranslations of the King James Version of the Bible.  For example, 2 Nephi 24:12 is copied from Isaiah 14:12:  "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!"  “Lucifer” is not a correct translation of the original biblical text.

The error can be traced back to the fact that the King James translators relied heavily on the Latin (Vulgate) translation of the Bible by Jerome, from the 4th century A.D.  Jerome, in turn, relied on the Greek (Septuagint) translation of the Old Testament. 

The only place the word "Lucifer" occurs in the entire Bible is in the King James Version at this passage.  Other translations do not have "Lucifer" there (or anywhere at all), but translate the word correctly as "day-star", "star of the morning", or "morning star".

This passage, when read in context, is addressed to the king of Babylon, who was very proud and haughty and surrounded in worldly glory, but who was to be destroyed.  "Lucifer" is used in Jerome's Latin (and, following Jerome, in the King James Version) to translate the Hebrew word “helel”, which means "morning star", which refers to the planet Venus.  The Hebrew root “h-l-l” means "shine" or "boast," so it is probably a taunting pun in the Hebrew Isaiah.  There were two Greek names for Venus, both similar: either “heos-phoros” meaning "dawn-bringer", or “phos-phoros” meaning "light-bringer".  In the Septuagint (Greek) translation of this passage, probably made in the first or second century B.C., they translated “helel” with the Greek word “heos-phoros”.  When Jerome translated the Bible into Latin, he used the Septuagint as his source and simply translated the Greek word for Venus into the Latin name of that planet, which is an exact translation of the Greek “phos-phoros”:  “luci-fer”, from the Latin roots “luc” ("light") and “fer” ("bring, bear, carry").

It was not until well into the Christian era that the idea arose that "Lucifer" was a name, and that the verse applied to Satan and not to the king of Babylon.  It is probably influenced by the (erroneous) assumption that Luke 10:18 (saying that Satan fell as lightning from heaven) is a reference to the Isaiah passage.

Oddly, the only other place in the Bible where the term "morning star" (“phosphoros”) is used is at 2 Peter 1:19, where it refers to Jesus!

Revelations 2:28 and 22:16 also refer to the "morning star", meaning Jesus, but use a different Greek phrase made up of the Greek words for "morning" and "star".  One verse promises the "morning star" as a reward to the faithful; the latter verse is Jesus saying "I Jesus...am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star."

This error is compounded in modern Mormon theology, with Lucifer as the name of a character in the endowment ceremony.  

Other KJV mistranslations preserved in the Book of Mormon include “virgin” from 2 Nephi 17:14 and “satyr” from 2 Nephi 23:21.

## 7. Impossible Stories
From the text of the Book of Mormon, we know approximately how many people arrived in the New World with Lehi.  Also, we know something about the population growth in the Book of Mormon from accounts of wars that include the number of fatalities.

Scientists have a good idea of the rates of growth of human populations in a variety of times and circumstances.  The rate of growth required to support the Book of Mormon has not occurred anywhere else on earth until the 20th century.

There are two possible ways to reconcile the Book of Mormon population figures:  (1) miraculous population growth, or (2) mixture with an existing population.

The latter option is the way most apologists today explain the impossible.  However, this requires that Lehi’s descendants mixed with a larger existing population, but retained leadership of the mixed population.  

It is also contrary to Book of Mormon text itself, which testifies that the land was preserved for the descendants of Lehi.

2 Nephi 1:8-9
> And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance. Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that **they may possess this land unto themselves**...and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever.

Other impossible stories include accounts of the Jaredite barges, of building a temple like Solomon’s, of Nephi making many steel swords, of two million people dieing in one battle at the Hill Cumorah, and of the battle between Shiz and Coriantumr.

## 8. Retold Stories
Whole stories are borrowed from the Bible and the Apocrypha and modified for use in the Book of Mormon.  For example, compare Ether 12 and 2 Corinthians 12:

In Ether, Moroni has a problem with writing.  In 2 Corinthians, Paul has an unspecified problem which he refers to as his “thorn”.

They both have a weakness.

Both pray to God to fix their weaknesses.

God tells both of them “no”.

Both stories include comparisons of weakness and strength.

Both stories use the phrase “grace is sufficient”.  This is highly significant, since this phrase appears in only one verse in the Book of Mormon and one verse in the Bible.  How likely is that, if the similarities between these two stories is purely coincidental?

There are other “borrowed” stories in the Book of Mormon, such as the beheading of Laban and the raising of King Lamoni.

## 9. 19th Century Theology 
The phrase “infinite atonement” occurs a few times in the Book of Mormon, such as at 2 Nephi 9:7:
> Wherefore, it must needs be an **infinite atonement**—save it should be an **infinite atonement** this corruption could not put on incorruption.  Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration.  And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.

This phrase does not appear in the Bible.  In ancient times, there was no debate about whether or not the atonement is infinite.  Nobody was thinking in those terms.

However, it was a subject of debate in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  Ideas evolve over time, with people building on earlier ideas, adding to and combining them, and debating their merits.  By the time of Joseph Smith, there had been centuries of debate on Christian subjects such as original sin, free agency, the nature of sin, the infinite or finite nature of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the depravity of man, predestination, irresistible grace, etc.  The Book of Mormon takes a stand on many of these debates of Joseph Smith’s day.  

It is easy to see how these ideas had evolved over time and then ended up in the Book of Mormon.  It seems very unlikely that these ideas would have also evolved anciently, independently from those centuries of debate to build upon.

Here are some references from the decades right before the publication of the Book of Mormon discussing the concept of an infinite atonement and the infinite nature of sin.  Some of these authors think the atonement is infinite, others don’t.

Gospel Advocate, Volume 1, Simon Burton, January 1 1824
> We sin against no greater law than we can understand therefore as our understandings are finite so is sin. It is limited to our finite understandings. That in the law which is above or beyond our comprehension or conception would be to us as no law and where there is no law there is no transgression. Thus the argument consider it as we please will limit sin to our limited understandings Sin then is finite not infinite.

The Christian Repository: Volume 3, January 1, 1823, D. Watson
> Sin is the transgression of the law and in another place unrighteousness is sin. Sin therefore presupposes law for where there is no law there is no transgression. A law must always include the idea of subjects possessing certain powers of agency to whose capacities it is calculated to be adapted. In those subjects then sin is found when they exercise their moral powers in opposition to the instructions of the law…The doctrine of endless misery which we believe is unsupported by revelation has led to a variety of conclusions that appear equally unsupportable. Among these we account the doctrine of the infinite nature of sin. But it requires no very powerful intellect to discern that the latter idea is absolutely necessary to maintain the former. As we believe neither is true we will offer a few arguments against the infinity of sin.

Christian Pioneer, 1827
> We maintain, that man is not created in a condition which makes an infinite atonement necessary; nor do we believe that any creature can fail into a condition, from which God may not deliver him, without this rigid expedient.

A Course of Critical Lectures: Or, Systematical Theology, in Four Parts, John Samuel Thompson, 1825
> Moreover if Christ have made an infinite atonement for the satisfaction of divine justice, why will not all be saved? Will God be unjust to himself? Can he punish himself for no purpose?

The Theological Magazine: Volume 1, January 1, 1796, Cornelius Davis
> This punishment is either temporary or endless. If it be endless, it is just and deserved, because threatened by a just God, and we become liable to it by his threatening. But if we deserve an endless punishment, sin is an infinite evil, and so requires an infinite atonement.

The works of the Reverend Andrew Fuller, January 1, 1820
> In stating my sense of the limited extent of Christ’s death I admitted that the sufferings of Christ were sufficient for the salvation of the whole world had the race of mankind or the multitude of their offences been a thousand times more than they are if it had pleased God to render them effectual to that end I do not consider the necessity of an atonement as arising from the number of sins but from the nature of them. As the same sun which is necessary to enlighten the present inhabitants of the earth is sufficient to enlighten many millions more and as the same perfect obedience of Christ which was necessary for the justification of one sinner is sufficient to justify the millions that are saved so I apprehend the same infinite atonement would have been necessary for the salvation of one soul consistently with justice as for the salvation of a world.

A correspondence by letters: between Samuel C. Loveland, Preacher of the doctrine of universal salvation, and Rev. Joseph Laberee, Pastor of the Congregational Church and Society in Jerico, Vermont, January 1, 1818
> You tell me that you do not believe an infinite atonement necessary in order for God to be just in the pardon of sin. But if an infinite atonement be not necessary such an atonement has not been made unless you suppose God has performed an unnecessary labor. And if an infinite atonement has not been made Jesus Christ is not a divine person. For if he be a divine person his sufferings and obedience must have been of infinite value of course he made an infinite atonement.

It seems clear that the author of the Book of Mormon put nineteenth century ideas into the mouths of ancient prophets.  Here are some more phrases and concepts from the Book of Mormon that are not found in the Bible, but are found in writings and sermons of the 1700’s and early 1800’s:

merciful plan | demands of justice | spiritual death
Great Creator | it behooveth God | crosses of the world
endless duration | awful monster | secret combinations
family of Adam | claim upon them | rot and crumble
mother earth | our first parents | shut out from presence of God
cunning plan | devil delighteth | God who gave them breath

## 10. Conflict with Mormon Doctrine
Trinitarians believe that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three distinct personages, but at the same time are one inseparable God.  Many Christian sects are trinitarian.  Mormons, on the other hand, believe that while God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost are united in purpose, they are not all one being.

However, the trinitarian view was very common during Joseph Smith’s early years, and the Book of Mormon espoused trinitarian ideas.  Early church members accepted a trinitarian version of the godhead.

The first edition of the Book of Mormon contained these verses:

1 Nephi 11:18 (1830)
> Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of God, after the manner of the flesh.

1 Nephi 11:21 (1830)
> Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Eternal Father!

These verses show that Jesus and God are the same being, which is compatible with trinitarianism.  Since this is in conflict with what we now consider to be Mormon doctrine, these verses had to be “fixed” in later editions:

1 Nephi 11:18 (current)
> Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of **the Son of** God, after the manner of the flesh.

1 Nephi 11:21 (current)
> Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even **the Son of** the Eternal Father!

However, even in today’s version of the Book of Mormon, many verses still describe a trinitarian view of the godhead.  Mosiah 15:1-5 perfectly captures this view:

> I would that ye should understand that God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.  And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son—The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son—And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.  And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.

This scripture does not represent current Mormon theology, except as we twist simple meanings to make things fit.

Alma 11:44 is another verse that shows the trinitarian roots of the Book of Mormon:
> ...before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God....

2 Nephi 21:31 and Mormon 7:7 also describe the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as “one God”.

The current edition of the Book of Mormon makes no mention of God and Christ as separate, resurrected, exalted physical men.  Joseph Smith’s earliest accounts of the First Vision were also in harmony with a trinitarian world view.  Only in later accounts did two personages appear to Joseph Smith.  

Other areas of conflict between the Book of Mormon and modern Mormon theology include the reasons for different races (and presumably that righteousness can turn dark skin white), the purposes of temples, and the circumstances under which polygamy should be practiced.

## 11. Jesus as Mass Murderer
3 Nephi 8 describes the terrible destruction that immediately preceded Jesus’ visit in the Book of Mormon.  The text makes it clear that even children were killed.  In the next chapter, Jesus takes credit for the killing:

3 Nephi 9:2
> Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen! 

In other words:  The devil and his angels are happy that Jesus just killed a bunch of people, but it was their own fault.

3 Nephi 9:3
> Behold, that great city **Zarahemla** have I a burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof. 

In other words:  I killed them.

3 Nephi 9:4 ff
> And behold, that great city **Moroni** have I caused to be a sunk in the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof to be drowned. And behold, that great city **Moronihah** have I covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against them.  And behold, the city of **Gilgal** have I caused to be sunk, and the inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the earth; Yea, and the city of **Onihah** and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of **Mocum** and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of **Jerusalem** and the inhabitants thereof; and waters have I caused to come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come up any more unto me against them. And behold, the city of **Gadiandi**, and the city of **Gadiomnah**, and the city of **Jacob**, and the city of **Gimgimno**, all these have I caused to be sunk, and made hills and valleys in the places thereof; and the inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the depths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up any more unto me against them. And behold, that great city **Jacobugath**, which was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them.  And behold, the city of **Laman**, and the city of **Josh**, and the city of **Gad**, and the city of **Kishkumen**, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to declare unto them concerning their wickedness and their abominations. And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I did send down a fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry unto me from the ground against them. And a many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their abominations. 

That’s a total of sixteen cities worth of people that Jesus murdered.  The same Jesus who had just said “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”

3 Nephi 10:9-10
> And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away. And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and **their mourning was turned into joy**, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.

How is it that just three days after so many of their people were killed, the remainder were suddenly happy about it?

## Conclusion
Did you know that the Book of Mormon describes historical events that never happened, quotes scriptures that weren’t yet written, and references items and concepts that did not yet exist?  In fact, there is a conside
